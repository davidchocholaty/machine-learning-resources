# A Journey through Machine Learning

A repository containing mostly free resources that I find useful for my machine learning studies.

## 2023
##### Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (book)
https://people.engr.tamu.edu/guni/csce421/files/AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf

*One of the most classic books on machine learning and artificial intelligence, covering topics such as search algorithms, constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), Bayesian networks, and more.*

##### Neural Networks: Zero to Hero

*IMHO the first video is the best explanation of the neural networks basics that I have found, I surely recommend.*

##### Neural Networks (book)
http://www.dkriesel.com/en/science/neural_networks

*Used in the Soft Computing course at BUT FIT. Not recommended for beginners, but it provides a nice cross-section of various general neural network types.*

## 2024
##### Machine Learning Crash Course
https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course

*In my opinion, this is an awesome introductory guide, also friendly for beginners. It covers the most important parts of machine learning that are taught in the university courses I graduated from as well.*

##### Deep Learning (book)
https://www.deeplearningbook.org/

*I believe this is one of the most famous deep learning books, so no further comment is needed.*

##### Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (book)
https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf

*One of the best books on reinforcement learning.*

##### Clean Code (book)
https://github.com/jnguyen095/clean-code/blob/master/Clean.Code.A.Handbook.of.Agile.Software.Craftsmanship.pdf

*Just needed.*
