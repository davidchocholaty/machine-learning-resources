# A Journey through Machine Learning

A repository containing resources that I will find useful during my machine-learning studies.

## 2023:
##### Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (searching, CSPs, Bayesian Networks and other)
https://people.engr.tamu.edu/guni/csce421/files/AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf

##### Neural Networks: Zero to Hero (IMHO the first video is the best explanation of the neural networks basics that I have found, I surely recommend)

##### Neural Networks (used in the course Soft Computing at BUT FIT)
