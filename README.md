# A Journey through Machine Learning

A repository containing mostly free resources that I find useful for my machine learning studies.

## 2023
##### Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (book)
https://people.engr.tamu.edu/guni/csce421/files/AI_Russell_Norvig.pdf

*One of the most classic books on machine learning and artificial intelligence, covering topics such as search algorithms, constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), Bayesian networks, and more.*

##### Neural Networks: Zero to Hero

*IMHO the first video is the best explanation of the neural networks basics that I have found, I surely recommend.*

##### Neural Networks (book)
http://www.dkriesel.com/en/science/neural_networks

*Used in the Soft Computing course at BUT FIT. Not recommended for beginners, but it provides a nice cross-section of various general neural network types.*

## 2024
##### Machine Learning Crash Course
